<p>After working in SaaS sales for a few years I realized I wanted to learn how to build digital products and learn to code.</p>

<p>I currently work as a Java/SpringBoot developer in the financial services industry in New York City.</p>

<p>In my free time I can be found coding, playing pickup basketball, or biking around New York City.</p>

<p>If you are reading this page and you are considering transitioning into programming work, I would be happy to talk/help in anyway I can. I can be reached at <a className="project_link" href="https://twitter.com/jakeduchen" alt="link to jakes twitter" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">@jakeduchen</a></p>
