<p>After university, I spent a few years working in SaaS sales. Rather than just selling digital products, I wanted to know how sofware works as well. A combination of self-study, online, and in person learning helped me become a field engineer at an autonoumous guided vehicle company based in Boston where I traveled America's factories to program (C++) self driving vehicles.</p>

<p>I recently returned to New York to seek additional software engineering training and work.</p>

<p>In my freetime, I can likely be found working on a personal coding project, playing pickup basketball, or cycling around New York City.</p>
